  *Can I Dance With You?* is in   the first level of Chinese Breeze which
  contains approximately 300 words.

  Description of the book: A smart young man suddenly gets into big trouble. He
  just fell in love with a pretty girl, but now the police come and want to
  arrest him. The bank he works for just lost ten million dollars, and the
  police list him as a suspect. Of course he is not the robber! He even knows
  who did it. But can he find evidence to prove it to the police? It’s all just
  too much. Also, will he be able to see his girlfriend again?

  This course covers all of the vocabulary in the 8 chapters.
